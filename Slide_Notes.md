###### Assumptions

	- Because that’s the help that I need myself
3. Risk is a distributed phenomena 
4. Ideas can come from anywhere and anyone
2. Defining Entrepreneur

4. Defining Profit

	- “Profit is the result of understanding the underlying nature of reality ahead of your peers.” Alain de Botton
5. We get the behaviour we design for


Risk is a distributed phenomena, our response is not a choice. 
Who’s ideas should be brought in to material observable universe?

Given that we have a distributed database with a state transition rule which puts honesty before fraud.

In short: whose ideas get to be brought in to the material world?
	Who gets the land, the money, the food, the security

The internet is an interconnected network
	It networks networks

It’s a values innovation
	Please hold me accountable
		Please help me discover and become the person I want to be remembered as.

The regulation is in the code and the community

	Culture is the way we relate to infinity

People tend to behave the way they are expected to.

My time at Feathercoin and Hullcoin taught me that it wasn’t the money people wanted, it was each other. They wanted what the money allowed them to do. 

For many of us our goals are vague. We don’t know what we want to be because we haven’t acted yet. We think with the whole body. 

The question is can I tell you a story today that will sound true for everyone?


People were high on ideas (crowd funds)
	But execution was slow and failure was the norm
People wanted to feel connected (conferences)

So my opening question today is who should get the land, the food, the money and the security?

Bring up harmony with nature
	Not every instrument needs to play the same note
	To ask for help is a very human thing
		It expresses the desire to change
		

	•	Help me become the person I want to be remembered as

It’s inter-generational
The wealthy
The powerful 
The people
