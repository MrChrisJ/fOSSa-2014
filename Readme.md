I have been invited to speak at [fOSSa 2014](https://fossa.inria.fr/) Stephane Ribas at [INRA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/164385) on the 19th November 2014.  

This repo will be a learning process as I will be tracking my time and work using tools from [Quantified Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self) movement such as [Rescue Time](https://www.rescuetime.com/), [Toggle](https://www.toggl.com/) and of course the Blockchain.  

Understanding technology as a sense, an objective witness without the capacity for care which opens up a theatre for history itself to be the final judge of our actions in the present.

### Special thanks
I am grateful to the following people for inspiring my thoughts. I do not make any claim to expertise but these are the real experts who have helped to inform my thinking: Chief Scientist **Peter Todd**, philosopher king **Andreas Antonopoulos** & prodigy **Vitalik Buterin**

### Underlying Assumptions
###### First set - Assumptions 

While forming this presentation and listening to my thoughts I formed a basis of premises and assumptions which which are as follows:

1. All people across the globe are disposed to the same number of hours in a day
	- All people independent of place and culture have discretionary attention
	- Good decisions require information and judgement
2. All people across the globe share a need for common resources
	- This common need once satisfied creates a basis on which our uniqueness can emerge
3. Risk is a distributed phenomena
	- Therefore it requires a distributed response
		- “Profit: the reward for correctly grasping an element of reality ahead of your peers.” ~[Alain de Botton](https://twitter.com/alaindebotton/status/528998938603696128)
4. Ideas can come from anywhere and anyone
	- Tribes today are not defined by geographic borders
		- Tribes are interconnected communities
5. Uniqueness emerges at the intersections of our ideas & common interests

###### Second Set - Definitions

1. Defining Entrepreneur
	- The ability to anticipate demand
	- The ability to de-risk an uncertain environment for another
2. Defining Business
	- A sequence of activities agreed upon by a group of individuals
	- To be sustainable a business must find an addressable market
	- To be sustainable a business must [produce a product of service for less than it is able to sell it for](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm)
4. Defining Profit
	- Profit is a way of quantifying progress
	- Profit is epiphenomenal, it is the result of getting things right
		- Therefore financial profit is not a goal in and of itself
5. The internet is network of networks
	- Every network it touches it liberates
	- The internet’s various protocols raise the marginal cost of keeping information secret (slower moving information relative to its wider context)
	- The internet allows for existence to emerge without a stable spatial referent
	- It allows peers to communicate their intent without prejudice
6. Bitcoin is a continuation of the Internet’s development
	- Bitcoin is the Internet
	- Bitcoin is a distributed database with a state transition rule
	- Bitcoin brings together the databases of the large networks on the internet together with the offline identities of individuals to create reducing information asymmetry across space, time and human cultures

###### Conclusions based on the premises

For now I reason that:

1. As architects of this system of networks we will observe the behaviour we design for
	- Therefore it is in our interests to understand the whole system from first principles an up
2. Bitcoin has introduced the incentive engineering in to a global information network which informs behaviours offline which cause corresponding online activity observable from anywhere on the network
	- It behoves us as the experts ‘sophos’ to educate the people ‘demos’ or we risk creating further division, hyper specialisation and catastrophe
