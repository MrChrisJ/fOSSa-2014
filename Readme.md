I have been invited to speak at [fOSSa 2014](https://fossa.inria.fr/) Stephane Ribas at [INRA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/164385) on the 19th November 2014.  

This repo will be a learning process as I will be tracking my time and work using tools from [Quantified Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self) movement such as [Rescue Time](https://www.rescuetime.com/), [Toggle](https://www.toggl.com/) and of course the Blockchain.  

Understanding technology as a sense, an objective witness without the capacity for care which opens up a theatre for history itself to be the final judge of our actions in the present.  

### Underlying Assumptions

###### First set of definitions 

1. We are all disposed to the same number of hours in a day
	- Good decisions require information and good judgement
	- I want to help people make well informed decisions
	- Because that’s the help that I need myself
2. Risk is a distributed phenomena
	- Therefore it requires a distributed response
3. Ideas can come from anywhere and anyone

###### Second Set of assumptions

1. Defining Entrepreneur
