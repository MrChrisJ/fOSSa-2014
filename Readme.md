# Presentation at fOSSa 2014

I have been invited to speak at [fOSSa 2014](https://fossa.inria.fr/) Stephane Ribas at [INRA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/164385) on the 19th November 2014.  

Details on my attendance are still to be worked out as I have very little time to spare these days. This repo will be a learning process as I will be tracking my time and work using tools from [Quantified Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self) movement such as [Rescue Time](https://www.rescuetime.com/), [Toggle](https://www.toggl.com/) and of course the Blockchain.  

Understanding technology as a sense, an objective witness without the capacity for care which opens up a theatre for history itself to be the final judge of our actions in the present.  

Justice for those who work the hardest, sacrifice the most and provide greatest long term value for history to remember and learn from.
